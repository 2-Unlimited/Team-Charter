## Values

Values are the roots of the things we like and don't like in a situation. Values are the large-scale criteria we use to judge what we see, think, and do. Making values explicit is important because without values, practices quickly become rote, activities performed for their own sake but lacking any purpose or direction.

If everyone on the team chooses to focus on what's important to the team, what is it they should focus on?

- **Communication:** 

  Communication is important for creating a sense of team and effective cooperation.

- **Simplicity:**
  
  What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?

- **Feedback:**

  Strive to generate as much feedback as we can handle as quickly as possible. The sooner you know, the sooner you can adapt.

- **Courage:**

  Courage is effective action in the face of fear. The courage to speak truths, pleasant or unpleasant, fosters communication and trust. The courage to discard failing solutions and seek new ones encourages simplicity. The courage to seek real, concrete answers creates feedback.

- **Respect:**

  No one is intrinsically worth more than anyone else. The contributions of each person on the team need to be respected. I am important and so are you.

## Principles

Bridging the gap between values and practices are principles. Principles are a set of domain-specific guidelines for finding practices in harmony with our values. Principles give us a better idea of what a practice is intended to accomplish. Understanding the principles gives you the opportunity to create practices that work with your existing practices and your overall goals.

- **Humanity:**

  - Basic safety
  - Accomplishment: the opportunity and ability to contribute to our society.
  - Belonging: the ability to identify with a group from which they receive validation and accountability and contribute to its shared goals.
  - Growth: the opportunity to expand their skills and perspective.
  - Intimacy: the ability to understand and be understood deeply by others.

- **Economics:**

  Make sure what you are doing has business value, meets business goals, and serves business needs.

- **Mutual Benefit:**

  There are always solutions to any problem that cost one person while benefitting another. When the situation is desperate, these solutions seem attractive. Mutual benefit is searching for practices that benefit me now, me later, and my customer as well. 

- **Improvement:**

  There is no perfect process. There is no perfect design. There are no perfect stories. We can, however, perfect our process, our design, and our stories. The cycle is to do the best you can today, striving for the awareness and understanding necessary to do better tomorrow. It doesn't mean waiting for perfection in order to begin.

- **Diversity:**

  Teams need to bring together a variety of skills, attitudes, and perspectives to see problems and pitfalls, to think of multiple ways to solve problems, and to implement the solutions. Respecting others and maintaining myself smooths communication in times of stress.

- **Reflection:**

  Good teams don't just do their work, they think about how they are working and why they are working. They analyze why they succeeded or failed. They don't try to hide their mistakes, but expose them and learn from them. No one stumbles into excellence. Reflection should not be limited to "official" opportunities. Reflection comes after action. Learning is action reflected. To maximize feedback, reflection is mixed with doing.

- **Flow:**

  Delivering a steady flow of valuable software by engaging in all the activities of development simultaneously. A continuous flow of activities rather than discrete phases. Any time you move away from flow, resolve to return. Resolve the problems that disrupted your flow and get back to improving flow as soon as you can.

- **Opportunity:**

  Learn to see problems as opportunities for change. The attitude of "survival" leads to just enough problem solving to get by. To reach excellence, problems need to turn into opportunities for learning and improvement, not just survival. Consciously choose to transform each problem into an opportunity: an opportunity for personal growth, deepening relationships, and improved software.

- **Failure:**

  If you're having trouble succeeding, fail. If you knew the best way to implement the story you'd just implement it that way. Given that you don't already know the best way, what's the cheapest way to find out? When you don't know what to do, risking failure can be the shortest, surest road to success.

- **Quality:**

  Projects don't go faster by accepting lower quality. They don't go slower by demanding higher quality. Pushing quality higher often results in faster delivery; while lowering quality standards often results in later, less predictable delivery. A concern for quality is no excuse for inaction.

- **Baby Steps:**

  What's the least you could do that is recognizably in the right direction? Under the right conditions, people and teams can take many small steps so rapidly that they appear to be leaping. Baby steps acknowledge that the overhead of small steps is much less than when a team wastefully recoils from aborted big changes.

- **Accepted Responsability:**

  Responsibility cannot be assigned; it can only be accepted. Whoever signs up to do work also estimates it. Similarly, the person responsible for implementing a story is ultimately responsible for the design, implementation, and testing of the story
