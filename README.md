## Values

Values are the roots of the things we like and don't like in a situation. Values are the large-scale criteria we use to judge what we see, think, and do. Making values explicit is important because without values, practices quickly become rote, activities performed for their own sake but lacking any purpose or direction.

If everyone on the team chooses to focus on what's important to the team, what is it they should focus on?

- Communication: 

  Communication is important for creating a sense of team and effective cooperation.

- Simplicity: 
  
  What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?

- Feedback: 

  Strive to generate as much feedback as we can handle as quickly as possible. The sooner you know, the sooner you can adapt.

- Courage:

  Courage is effective action in the face of fear. The courage to speak truths, pleasant or unpleasant, fosters communication and trust. The courage to discard failing solutions and seek new ones encourages simplicity. The courage to seek real, concrete answers creates feedback.

- Respect:

  No one is intrinsically worth more than anyone else. The contributions of each person on the team need to be respected. I am important and so are you.
